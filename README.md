 Due to the inclusion of social robots in education, the field of education has undergone
 remarkable development and enhancement in terms of learning and teaching experiences.
 However, the field of education is still challenged with the same problem: student engage
ment. This project’s goal is to enhance the learning and teaching experience with two
 main focuses: social robots and storytelling.
 Arange of scientific studies supports the importance of integrating social robots in the
 education field through storytelling. To be specific, a study done on personalized story
telling with social robot Haru found that compared to traditional media such as books or
 audiobooks, social robots can narrate stories in a better way using their physical presence
 as well as multimodal interactive behaviour[8]. In another research it is found that the
 physical presence of a robot tutor increases cognitive learning gains of the children. [3]
 In this project, the social robot takes the role of the “teaching assistant” in the class
rooms and its language is storytelling.
 The teacher communicates with the robot over the web user interface where the teacher
 can model the session. This education model with the social robot can be used for the
 following two purposes:
 1. Integrate narrative techniques in teaching: Researches show that storytelling tech
niques in teaching, create an engaging class environment by promoting student en
gagement and critical thinking[5]. Teachers can use this model to generate tailor
made stories based on their course content. The “age-group” based approach of the
 model makes the generated answers more relevant for the students while bettering
 the understanding and retention of the subject.
 2. Storytelling session: Based on the feedback I have collected from teachers; they
 often struggle with the rigidity of the school storybooks. This model provides a
 good balance between teacher authority and the AI story generation model as the
 teacher can tune the story in each step. Meanwhile, it is also possible to generate
 questions based on the story to evaluate the classroom’s engagement.
 This model can be outlined as follows:
 1. Teacher selects story details; language,AI level, age group then specifies the user
 prompt
 2. Story generation based on the preferences
 3. (Optional) Modification of the story either through editing the story or by regener
ation with/without remarks
 4. Social robot storytelling session
 5. (Optional)Question generation through AI-generated query session or the user can
 write the questions to be asked later on.
 6. Q&A session with the social robot
 This project is intended to be used with any social robot. During the project develop
ment; the project is tested on UBTECH’s Alpha-Mini Humanoid Robot and on LuxAI’s
 QTrobot social robot.
